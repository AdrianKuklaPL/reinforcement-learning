# Markov Decision Process (MDP) Analysis

## Objective
This repository contains analyses of two Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): Blackjack and CartPole. The goal is to apply and examine key techniques such as Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, Q-learning and SARSA.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11.9
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code

## Analyses Performed
- Implementation of Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, and Q-learning for Blackjack and CartPole.
- Replication of MDP behaviors and policies.
- Visualization of policy performance using tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are required and can be installed via `pip`:
- `gymnasium`
- `bettermdptools`
- `random`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

## How to Replicate
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdrianKuklaPL/reinforcement-learning.git
